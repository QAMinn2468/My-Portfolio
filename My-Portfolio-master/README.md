# Portfolio for Kimberly McCaffrey

Originaly created for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree project 1 of 7 (see Nanodegree 1 portfolio).  The original can be found at: https://github.com/QAMinn2468/Nanodegree-1-Portfolio.  This project is written in HTML & CSS.


# Background/updates

After KL Grady & I won the VetHacks-DE hackathon, we founded My Move Binder, LLC.  We rode the wave of excitement, and continued with grit, but the truth is we each had more important things to do (like get a job $$).  Creating the business was a valuable learning experience and it was closed October 2018.

In October 2018, I finished my Front-End Development Nanodegree at Udacity.

In November 2018, I was hired by MAXX Potential.  I perform QA manual regression testing for a client's website, and learned SQL ASAP for the job.



# The Future

In 2019, I would like to move to the Minneapolis, MN area, and start a new position with a larger, more established company, while staying in the Software Quality Assurance field.  It will be very hard to find another tech company that is evenly male:female, and promotes diversity as much as MAXX.
